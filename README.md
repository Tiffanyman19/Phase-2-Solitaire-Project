     The four aces form the foundations. As it becomes available, each ace must be played to a row above the piles. Cards in the appropriate suit are then played on the aces in sequence - the two, then the three, and so on - as they become available.

        Any movable card may be placed on a card next-higher in rank if it is of opposite color. Example: A black five may be played on a red six. If more than one card is face up on a tableau pile, all such cards must be moved as a unit.

     When there is no face-up card left on a pile, the top face-down card is turned up and becomes available.

        Only a king may fill an open space in the layout. The player turns up cards from the top of the stock in groups of three, and the top card of the three may be used for building on the piles, if possible, played on a foundation. If a card is used in this manner, the card below it becomes available for play. If the up-card cannot be used, the one, two, or three cards of the group are placed face up on the waste pile, and the next group of three cards is turned up.

Spider Soliaire For One Suite and Four Suite(https://www.spider-palace.com/how-to-play-spider/) 
    (English)
        Spider traditionally uses two decks of French-suited playing cards: 104 cards in the suits Spades, Clubs, Hearts, and Diamonds. The 13 ranks – King, Queen, Jack, 10 to 2, and Ace – occur twice per suit.

        We set up our standard tables with all 104 cards in one suit at the Spider Palace, though. This way, it is easier to get to know the game at first. When you are ready, step up your Spider game and try the custom rules for  Spider four suits!

        The playing field consists of three areas – the stock on the top left, the tableau on the bottom, and the foundation on the top right. Above the playing field, you see the points you gained so far, how many moves you made, and how much time you have left in this round. 
        Following the Spider Solitaire rules, you must sort the 104 cards of the tableau and stock into sequences, and place them in the foundation. You can move the revealed cards between the piles of the tableau. Once the revealed cards make up a complete sequence, they will automatically move to the foundation. There are three conditions to meet for the cards to be a sequence:

        All cards of a sequence must be of the same suit.
        Each sequence must contain one card of each rank.
        The ranks in each sequence must be sorted and complete as follows: King, Queen, Jack, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2. You finish the sequence with an Ace.
